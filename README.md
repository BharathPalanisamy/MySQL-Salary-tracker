# Salary tracker
This application tracks and displays the top 5 people with highest salary from the year 1985 - 1990.
The employees database (Which is holds over 3.3 million records of data), this database
holds all of the records. Here is the link to their github to download their data. 
https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db


## How to download the database on your local computer
Download the github repo to your local computer. 

Make sure you have mysql database and workbench downloaded, to help save you time.

Next open up the terminal and then use $ mysqldump -u my_username -p database_name > output_file_path.

The terminal syntax above will help you to download the dump file one by one to store the records in the database.

## Outcome of this project
This project was help teach me how to connect to a database and display results from the database.
It helped me understand how to create a python script to display two log files, one log file being the results of the database
and the other log file to check if the application connected to the database. 
Third outcome of this project for me was to understand how to create an application which allows you to store the files wherever
you want in your local directory.
